## Lesson 1

you want a GPU
- NVIDIA GPU (cuda)
- using https://www.crestle.com/dashboard

fastai is a library of up to date, useful things
- it is built on top of pytorch

image classification is a useful first step for many problems
- learning Go (images of the board)
- faster than a human deciding which featuers to use

deep learning
- try to create an infinitely flexible function
- with all purpose parameter fitting
- which is fast and scalable
- neural network fulfills all these

universal approx theory:
- can solve as long as there is enough data

use gradient descent: computation intensive
- now not a big deal because GPUs are faster

google and microsoft have been heavily investing in deep learning

project idea: deep learning art
